# Machine Learning

A Machine Learning course teaches the principles and techniques of using algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn from and make predictions from data.

## Description

Welcome to the Machine Learning Tutorial Repository! This repository contains a variety of tutorials and examples on various machine learning topics, including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and more. Each tutorial is designed to be self-contained and easy to follow, with clear explanations and annotated code.
 
## Course Outline

The course is divided into the following sections:

- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Deep Learning
- Advanced Topics

Each section includes a set of slides, code examples, and exercises. The course also includes a final project where students can apply the concepts learned in the course to a real-world problem.

## Prerequisites

The course assumes a basic understanding of programming and statistics. Familiarity with Python is recommended, but not required as the course will provide a brief introduction to the python basics.

## Getting Started

To download a Amadeus project, you can use the git clone command. This command creates a copy of the repository in a new directory on your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/nileshparab42/Amadeus.git
```
To set up the project, you can use the pip command to install the required packages specified in the requirements.txt file.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all of the required packages for the project. If you are using a virtual environment for the project, you should activate the environment before running this command.
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will create a new virtual environment called myenv, activate it, and then install the required packages.

Once you have the repository on your local machine, navigate to the directory and start Jupyter notebook by running:
```
jupyter notebook
```
This will open a new browser window with the Jupyter notebook interface. From there, you can open any of the tutorial notebooks and start working through the exercises.
