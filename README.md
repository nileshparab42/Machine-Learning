## Getting Started

To download a Amadeus project, you can use the git clone command. This command creates a copy of the repository in a new directory on your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/nileshparab42/Amadeus.git
```
To set up the project, you can use the pip command to install the required packages specified in the requirements.txt file.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all of the required packages for the project. If you are using a virtual environment for the project, you should activate the environment before running this command.
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will create a new virtual environment called myenv, activate it, and then install the required packages.

Once you have the repository on your local machine, navigate to the directory and start Jupyter notebook by running:
```
jupyter notebook
```
This will open a new browser window with the Jupyter notebook interface. From there, you can open any of the tutorial notebooks and start working through the exercises.

## Prerequisites

The course assumes a basic understanding of programming and statistics. Familiarity with Python is recommended, but not required as the course will provide a brief introduction to the python basics.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions to this repository! If you have an idea for a new example or exercise, or have found a mistake in the existing materials, please feel free to submit a pull request.
